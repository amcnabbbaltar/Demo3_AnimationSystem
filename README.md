# Kinematics-Tutorial-for-Unity3D
Use of forward and inverse kinematics using CCD and Jacobian methods. Oriented for people willing to learn IK theory.

Built on Unity3D Version 2019.2.6f1

Q: Why does this exist ?

A: While there are certainly many approaches in achieving kinematics, forward and inverse with additionally more methods, I want to make the actual practical code of implementing these approahces public. This does not mean I'm here to do your homework, instead, I hope this will help you understand the basics, I'm confident, no I'm sure!, that my coding has lots of issues, please feel free to improve upon it.
